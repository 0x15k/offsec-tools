# offsec-tools

In this repository I will develop scripts to perform penetration testing (pentesting). Also, improve and understand existing offensive security tools.

The pentesting phases will be covered:
- Information gathering
- Asset scanning
- Vulnerability analysis
- Exploitation
- Post-exploitation
- Final Report
