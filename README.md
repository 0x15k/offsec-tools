# offsec-tools

In this repository I will develop scripts to perform penetration testing (pentesting). Also, improve and understand existing offensive security tools.

The pentesting phases will be covered:
1. Information Gathering
2. Scanning
3. Enumeration
4. Vulnerability analysis
5. Exploitation
6. Post-exploitation
7. Final Report
